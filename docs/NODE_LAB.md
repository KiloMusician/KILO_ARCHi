# Native Node Lab

Node Lab displays the existing desktop companion, shared source, kept lessons, temporary context and assistant receipts as a native graph. Open it from the workspace sidebar, Window menu or receipt details. Constellation, Radial and Flow are alternate layouts of the same records; search, type filters, zoom and a selectable list support inspection.

Selecting a node shows its recorded status and available source details. Open the existing Assistant, Work together, Memory or local receipts screen through the inspector. The footer exposes the existing assistant activity and Stop control while work is running.

The graph is derived on demand from CompanionStore. Reading and filtering it make no model call and create no graph database. Request-local reference labels are scoped by provider, request and captured input/context. Repeated labels in Compare do not become one global identity. Historical records do not restore withdrawn lesson words or reuse a temporary record's changed content. Private Qwen context is excluded from external-lane projections.

The projection caps displayed nodes/edges and reports truncation. A periodic presentation refresh checks expiry; it does not infer new relationships. Layout, proximity, citations and graph size do not establish truth, importance, learning or permission. Placement, identity, appearance, evolution, persistence and routing remain in their existing owners.

Source: [projection](../desktop/Sources/ARCHiDesktop/CompanionGraph.swift), [view](../desktop/Sources/ARCHiDesktop/CompanionGraphView.swift), [store integration](../desktop/Sources/ARCHiDesktop/CompanionGraphWorkspace.swift). Included domain, controlled store and native presentation tests cover source/lesson freshness, provider separation, stopped callbacks, bounded geometry and navigation. Their inclusion does not qualify this export; see [validation](ALPHA_VALIDATION.md).

Node Lab is inspection and navigation. It does not execute arbitrary drawn edges, infer social relationships, import a whole vault or create an agent swarm. Full keyboard traversal, VoiceOver use and representative larger-record usefulness remain qualification work.
